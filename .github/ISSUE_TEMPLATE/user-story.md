- Answer the following questions:
  - Who are we building this for?
  - What are they trying to achieve?
  - What’s the overall benefit they’re trying to achieve? How does it fit into the bigger picture?
- You can use the following format for user stories: "As a <type of user>, I want to <perform some task> so that I can <achieve some goal>."

# Estimation of Effort
- Provide an estimate of the amount of work that this user story will require to be completely and successfully implemented using the following estimation scale:
  - Not Specified
  - Trivial
  - Easy
  - Normal
  - Hard
- Try to avoid overthinking this process or spending too much time on estimation.
- The default option is "Not Specified" and you can leave it as such.

# Acceptance Criteria
- Describe the conditions that the software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer or other stakeholder.
- The acceptance criteria should be testable and act as testing guidelines for developers.
- Acceptance criteria should use the following format: "Given (how things begin), when (action taken), then (outcome of taking action)."
